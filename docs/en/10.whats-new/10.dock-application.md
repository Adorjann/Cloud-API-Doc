DJI Dock is expected to be delivered in Q4 of 2022. The internal test prototype is expected to be available in small batches around September. If you have the internal test requirement, you can pre-register and apply. We will carry out internal tests one by one according to the prototype situations and internal test requirements. Thanks for your attention.



**Registration and application method**ï¼š

Please [submit a request](https://sdk-forum.dji.net/hc/zh-cn/requests/new) for consultation registration and choose the "Apply for a DJI DOCK prototype". The title should be **DJI DOCK prototype application-*your company name*** and describe the applying scenario of DJI Dock in detail.


**Attention:** Because of the limited number of prototypes, after you submit the registration information, it doesn't mean you can get the internal test prototype for sure. We will send a commissioner to communicate with you for details. Thanks for your understanding.
