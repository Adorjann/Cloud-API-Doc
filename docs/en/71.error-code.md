## Error Code Explanation
1. Overall, the error code follows the format of "ABCDEF". A represents the source. BC represents the function module. DEF represents the module customized error. 
2. The error code description of HMS can not be directly obtained through the error code. Developer needs to complete the concatenation of the "Copy Key" according to the rules introduced in the [HMS Function](https://developer.dji.com/doc/cloud-api-tutorial/en/feature-set/dock-feature-set/hms.html). Search the error code description in the [hms.json](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/84f990b0bbd145e6a3930de0c55d3b2b/apicloud/hms.json) based on the "Copy Key". If there are variables in the description, developer needs to replace them according to the rules.
