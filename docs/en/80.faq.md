## When the dock performs a multi-dock task will Controller B be disconnected?

When a multi-dock task is being performed and the docks for takeoff and landing are set, the link for the controller B will be occupied. So the controller B will be disconnected.

## Why does the third-party platform experience prolonged wait time when executing one-key takeoff or wayline missions on the dock?

**Problem:** 
When the third-party platform uses the dock to execute one-key takeoff or wayline missions, the data consistency of the "Offline Map" and "Custom Flight Area" between the dock and cloud will be checked before each takeoff. If no reply from the cloud to this message, the dock has a timeout logic to wait for around 40 seconds.

**Solution:** 
If the third-party doesn't support the "Offline Map" and "Custom Flight Area" functions, developer can reply the following contents to the Obtain offline map protocol (Method: offline_map_get) and Obtain custom flight area file list protocol (Method: flight_areas_get).
