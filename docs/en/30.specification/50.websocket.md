For some feature, Websocket communication is required, so DJI Pilot2 and the server need to establish a Websocket channel. When DJI Pilot2 logs in and goes online through Webview, the server needs to respond to the URL address of the Websocket to DJI Pilot2, and then DJI Pilot2 will make a Websocket connection request.

The specific general message push interface protocol format is as follows:

```json
url: xxxx.xx.xxx  
method:post

body:
{
    "biz_code": "device_topo_update",
    "version":"1.0"
    "timestamp": 146052438362,
    "data":{
        "operator": "zhangsan", //It is recommended to use callsign directly
         // The specific content is adjusted with biz_code or sub_biz_code
    }
}
```
