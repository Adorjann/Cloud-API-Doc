## PILOT2 Publishes Topology Update for Online Devices

After loading the cloud module, PILOT2 immediately initiates an MQTT connection request to the server. After the connection request is successful, a status topic is sent to the server immediately afterwards.

**Communication method:** MQTT

**API interface:**

| Scenes        | Published topic             | Subscribed topic                  | remark |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Device online | `sys/product/#{pid}/status` | `sys/product/#{pid}/status_reply` |        |

**Parameter Description:**

- \#{pid}: Refers to the product ID of the gateway device. It is generally represented by the SN number of the device. Each device is different, so it is necessary to use wildcards when the server subscribes to Topic.

**Example:**

```json
// Topic: sys/product/#{pid}/status
// Gateway devices and sub devices are online.
{
    "tid": "tid001",
    "bid": "bid001",
    "method": "update_topo",
    "timestamp": 1234567890123,
    "data": {
        "type": 98,
        "sub_type": 0,
        "device_secret":"secret",
        "nonce":"nonce",
        "version": 1,
        "sub_devices":[{
            "sn": "drone001",
            "type": 116,
            "sub_type": 0,
            "index": "A",
            "device_secret":"secret",
            "nonce":"nonce", 
            "version": 1
        }]
    }
}

// Topic: sys/product/#{pid}/status
// Sub devices are offline.
{
    "tid": "tid001",
    "bid": "bid001",
    "method": "update_topo",
    "timestamp": 1234567890123,
    "data": {
        "type": 98,
        "sub_type": 0,
        "device_secret":"secret",
        "nonce":"nonce",
        "version": 1,
        "sub_devices":[]
    }
}

// Topic: sys/product/#{pid}/status_reply 
{
    "tid": "xxx",
    "bid": "xxx",
    "method": "update_topo",
    "timestamp": 1234567890123,
    "data": {
        "result": 0
    }
}
```

**Notice:**

*1. As long as there is a device topology change,  the PILOT2 side will send a topic to the server side to update the topology.*

*2. When the server side receives the status topic, it needs to send the status_reply topic to reply, otherwise the PILOT2 side will keep on pushing until it stops after receiving the reply.*
