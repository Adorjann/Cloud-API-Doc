## Sample Introduction

The `template.kml` file consists of three parts:

1. Creation information: It mainly contains the information of the route file itself, such as the creation and update time of the file.
2. Mission information: mainly includes the `wpml:missionConfig` element, which defines the global parameters of the route mission, etc.
3. Template information: It mainly contains the `Folder` element, which defines the template information of the route (such as waypoint flight, map-building aerial photography, oblique photography, and flight with flight path, etc.). Different route template types contain different elements.

The example file of `template.kml` is as follows (take the waypoint flight template as an example):

```xml
