## Overview

In the process of using DJI Pilot2, it is inevitable to encounter problems such as abnormal interface communication and function failure, and it is necessary to pull the Pilot2 log for diagnosis. In order to solve this problem, DJI Pilot2 also provides jSBridge interface for developers to pull the log. And upload the webview to the developer's own server for analysis.

*Note: DJI Pilot2 logs are encrypted, so the developer needs to provide the public key information for log encryption through the JsBridge interface, and the pulled logs also need to be decrypted to view them. DJI provides a JAR library for decrypting logs that can be decrypted by developers running scripts.*

Decryption method: Use plogdecoder. jar library to run scripts to decrypt the pulled logs. <a href="https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/84f990b0bbd145e6a3930de0c55d3b2b/admin/doc/f79959b0-f801-4cb5-9bee-b85c9320b313.jar" target="_blank">Download</a>

**Example:**

```shell
java -jar PlogDecoder.jar -key "Desktop/rsa_keys/pri.key" -log "/open_platform/log-2022-01-18.log".
//If the public key is not set, you can omit the -key parameter.
```

## API Interface

### Get Logs Path

The developer can get the path to the logs saved by the DJI Pilot2 via the js method and then can upload the logs via file upload.

API: Refer to《**JSBridge API References**》-`window.djiBridge.platformGetLogPath()`

### Set Logs Encrypt Key

DJI Pilot2 encrypts the logs when they are saved. If no encryption key has been set by the developer, it will be encrypted according to the DJI Pilot2's default key. If a key is set, the logs will be encrypted according to the developer's key.

API: Refer to《**JSBridge API References**》-`window.djiBridge.platformSetLogEncryptKey(String key)`

### Clear Logs Encrypt Key

If the encryption key set by the developer needs to be changed, you will need to clear the key saved in DJI Pilot2 and then set it again.

API: Refer to《**JSBridge API References**》-`window.djiBridge.platformClearLogEncryptKey()`

*Note: When clearing the encryption key, if there is already part of the log using the original key, it will not be re-encrypted. In this case, the developer needs to save the historical key himself to prevent the log file from not being opened.*
