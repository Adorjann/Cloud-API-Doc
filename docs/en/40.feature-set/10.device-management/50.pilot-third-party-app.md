## Overview

For business scenarios that cannot be met by using DJI Pilot2, developers can develop a lightweight APP to be used together with Pilot2, such as intercom, special task commands, work orders, etc. In this way, for users, they can directly open the three-party APP through the webview page of Pilot2. While developer only needs to automatically invoke the JsBridge interface to wake up the third-party APP when opening the WebView page. The detailed configuration can be found at the link.
