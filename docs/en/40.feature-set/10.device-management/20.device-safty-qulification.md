## Overview

When Pilot2 and the airport access third-party clouds, in scenarios with high security requirements, the communication link needs to be encrypted to achieve secure data communication. By default, the device on the SSL link authenticates the server, and the server does not authenticate the device. If the server enables device authentication, the clientAuth configuration needs to be performed on the server.

DJI Pilot2 supports certificates issued by Godaddy. If developers need data security encryption, they can use the same certification authority certificate as DJI to achieve MQTT SSL authentication.
